# 📊 FirmWatch — AI Financial Risk Monitoring Agent

FirmWatch is an AI-powered financial risk monitoring system that helps enterprise finance teams detect invoice fraud, identify anomalies, and enforce compliance policies before payments are approved.

Rather than replacing analysts, FirmWatch acts as an intelligent decision-support layer that automates document analysis, cross-references enterprise records, and generates transparent audit trails.

> Reduce fraud risk. Improve compliance. Accelerate financial workflows.

## 🚀 Problem

Finance teams process thousands of invoices across fragmented systems. Manual verification is slow, error-prone, and vulnerable to fraud, duplicate payments, and policy violations, often with limited audit transparency.

FirmWatch automates cross-document financial reasoning while keeping humans in the loop.
